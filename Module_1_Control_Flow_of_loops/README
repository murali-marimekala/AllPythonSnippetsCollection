Module 1: Control Flow and Loops is a fundamental concept in programming that focuses on how to control the flow of execution in a program and how to repeat certain actions using loops. This module covers various control flow statements and loop structures that allow you to make decisions, execute specific blocks of code based on conditions, and repeat code execution.

Conditional Statements:

Conditional statements allow you to perform different actions based on different conditions.
The most common conditional statement is the if statement, which evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
You can extend the if statement with else and elif (short for "else if") clauses to handle multiple conditions.
Comparison Operators:

Comparison operators are used in conditional statements to compare values and produce a Boolean result (True or False).
Common comparison operators include:
== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
< (less than)
> (greater than)
<= (less than or equal to)
>= (greater than or equal to)
Logical Operators:

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in conditional statements.
The three logical operators are:
and: Returns True if both conditions are true.
or: Returns True if at least one of the conditions is true.
not: Reverses the result of the condition.
Loops:

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
There are two types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.
for loop: Iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.
while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
Break and Continue Statements:

The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of whether the loop condition is still true.
The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Nested Loops:

Python allows you to nest loops inside each other, where an inner loop is placed inside an outer loop.
This allows you to perform more complex iterations, such as iterating over multiple dimensions of a list or matrix.
Understanding control flow and loops is crucial for writing efficient and flexible programs. They enable you to make decisions based on conditions and repeat actions as needed. By mastering these concepts, you can create programs that perform different tasks based on user input, process large amounts of data, and automate repetitive tasks.
